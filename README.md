Hello Connections,
I'd like to share my end-to-end Machine Learning Project. 
As a part of my learning, I created an end-to-end ML project "Maharashtra's House Price Prediction". I did this project a month ago.

The goal of this project is to predict the house prices of various regions present in Maharashtra State.

I used python to perform Exploratory Data Analysis  after Data pre-processing in Jupyter Notebook using few essential libraries.

I deployed it using Streamlit  library on web. 
Do check my project out:- https://lnkd.in/dgFJTi-G

 It was a great learning experience and I also overcomed some new challenges. 

Please do share your valuable feedback in comment section
